# 🏘️ VOCES: Metropolitan Housing and Economic Analysis in Mexico

This repository contains the **computational and analytical workflow** developed as part of the research project  
**“VOCES: Housing in Mexico’s Metropolitan Areas.”**  
The project focuses on automating metropolitan-scale analyses of **housing** and **economic units**, integrating geospatial and statistical data from national sources.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop and automate a **replicable methodology** for analyzing metropolitan housing and economic structures across **92 metropolitan areas in Mexico**, based on official census and economic datasets.

## 🧩 Methodological components

1. **🏘️ Metropolitan Housing Automation**  
   Development of Python scripts to automate an existing methodology for housing typology construction.  
   - Based on INEGI census and geostatistical data (2010, 2020)  
   - Replicable at metropolitan and national scales  
   - Generates housing indicators and typologies per census block  

2. **🏭 Economic Units Automation**  
   Adaptation of the methodology to include the **DENUE** database (INEGI, 2010 & 2020), estimating employment and economic density by block.  
   - Processes ~20 GB of data  
   - Produces over **1.19 million records** across metropolitan areas  

3. **📊 Factorial and Correlation Analysis Automation**  
   Python-based scripts for automated **factor and correlation analysis**, applied to selected metropolitan areas (e.g., Mérida).  
   - Identifies statistical relationships among housing and economic indicators  
   - Generates correlation heatmaps and factor summaries  

4. **🧾 Comparative Indicator Sheets**  
   Design proposal for a **comparative municipal indicator sheet**, inspired by the *Atlas of Urban Expansion*.  
   - Visualizes selected housing and population indicators  
   - Intended for future automation and integration into dashboards
